# First Step

Since this is a challenge, I will describe here the way I'm thinking while doing
this project.

Some standards that I will try to follow:

- Break every requirement into small tasks.
- For each feature/component/class, a new branch.
- I will use [commit semantics](https://blog.geek
  hunter.com.br/o-que-e-commit-e-como-usar-commits-semanticos/).
- I will try to describe everything I do here, as much as I remember.
- _Maybe_ I will change something that I previously said, if I feel the need
  for.
